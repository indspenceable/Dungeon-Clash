Todo list:
---------

* Accept terminal style commands on the server
    * For instance, select map, add/remove characters
* implement character selection
* make some characters

The Ninja
---------

* He can move quickly (low movement cost)
* He deals OK damage, but his melee attack takes a while.
* special moves
    * He can throw shruikans 3-7 (10?) spaces away
    * He can vanish and appear a number of spaces away (possibly through walls, though)

The Ent
-------
* He moves very slowly
* He deals large damage, but again, it is pretty slow.
* Special Moves
    * Root -> Instead of moving, he can heal some damage, and still have the oppertunity to attack afterwards.
    * Uproot: Within a certain radius, he can hit any square. Does solid damage, but less than his attack does.

Robot
-----

* Moves at an... average pace? I guess.
* Fairly large damage, certainly quick for how much he does.
* Special Moves
    * Detonator : Choose a location near the robot. He sets off a bomb at that spot. Oh, it hit him? Oops...
    * Heavy punch - anyone directly next to the robot takes a big hit, for a big cooldown. They have a little extra cooldown because of this, and get knocked back a square. No space to move back? No worry, just take some extra damage.

Cat
---

* Moves quick.
* Attacks quick. Little damage
* Special Moves
    * Sneeze - everyone nearby has a little bit extra cooldown. Probably less than the ammount from the robot. But something. This takes the cat about as long to perform as it penalizes (probably a little more time to do the action...)
